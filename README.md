# 🧠 Breast Cancer Prediction 🔬

A machine learning project focused on predicting breast cancer using various classification algorithms. The goal is to assist early detection and diagnosis by leveraging supervised learning techniques.

## 📊 Overview

In this project, we applied multiple machine learning algorithms to predict whether a tumor is **benign** or **malignant** using breast cancer data.

✅ Models Applied:
- 🌲 Decision Tree (DT)
- 📈 Logistic Regression (LG)
- 📊 Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- 🧪 Naive Bayes (NB)
- 🌳 Random Forest (RF)

🏆 **Highest Accuracy:**  
**Support Vector Machine (SVM)** achieved an accuracy of **97%**! 🔥
